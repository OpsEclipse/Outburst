# User Interface Requirements

## 4. User Interface (UI) Requirements

- Mobile-First Design: The UI must be clean, high-contrast, and "tappable" for quick transitions.
- Key Elements:
  - Word Display: Large, centered text for maximum legibility while moving the device.
  - Next Word Button: A prominent, easy-to-hit button (often the entire bottom half of the screen) to cycle to the next word once guessed.
  - Visual Tension: Optional screen shaking or color shifts (e.g., turning from green to red) that synchronize with the audio speed.
- Accessibility: Simple "Start" and "Reset" controls with no complex menus during active gameplay.
