# Gameplay Mechanics

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics

- The Goal: A player describes the word shown on the screen to their teammates without saying the word itself or using rhyming clues. Once the team guesses correctly, the device is passed to the next player (usually from the opposing team).
- The Word Deck: The game pulls from a large database of random words, phrases, or pop-culture references.
- The Pass: The "bomb" (the mobile device) is passed physically from person to person. The player holding the device when it "explodes" loses the round for their team.

## 3. The Ticking Bomb (Timer Logic)

- Random Duration: To prevent players from "stalling" near the end, the timer is variable. It must explode at a random point between 90 and 130 seconds.
- Audio Feedback:
  - The game features a constant "ticking" sound effect.
  - Dynamic Speed: The frequency of the ticking must increase (speed up) as the time approaches the 90-second mark and continue to accelerate until the explosion occurs.
- The Explosion: A loud "boom" or buzzer sound marks the end of the round.
